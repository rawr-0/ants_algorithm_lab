Graph ant colony optimization algorithm for salesman problem
The student project aims to implement an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Python programming language and the NetworkX library.

The ACO algorithm is inspired by the behavior of ants searching for food, where the pheromone trails left by previous ants influence the decision of the following ones. The algorithm will start by generating a set of random solutions and then iteratively updating the pheromone trails based on the quality of the solutions found.

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) will provide an interactive and user-friendly way for the user to interact with the algorithm. The GUI will display the map of cities and the current solution found by the algorithm. The user will also be able to configure the algorithm's parameters, such as the number of ants and the evaporation rate.
